        <h1>The Sky Has Fallen</h1>
        <h2 id="description">An alien ship has exploded over your kingdom. Now alien treasure falls from the sky. Of course alien cockroaches survived the crash.</h2>
        <p>Collect as much treasure as you can, but watch out; those cockroaches want their treasure back! HINT: you can get close to them, but <u>not too close</u>!</p>
        <p>Use your ARROW KEYS to navigate the kingdom, collect the booty and avoid the alien cockroaches!</p>
